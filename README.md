# ToyCity Report Generator, Part 2

## Project Overview

Remember your boss in ToyCity Part 1? Well, they loved your sales report so much, they decided to surprise you with an extra special request.

Your boss was also wondering if you could somehow package the code, so they can reuse pieces of it in future sales reports.

In this lesson, you are going use the new skills you've learned to refactor your ToyCity code from Part 1. You will restructure your code using methods, and output your reports to a file instead of the command line.

You will also start using Git to track the changes you make to your project files.
